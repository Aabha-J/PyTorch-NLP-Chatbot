# Simple Clothes Store Chatbot ðŸ¤–
I used pytorch and nltk to train an ML model and create a chatbot that can tell some jokes and anwser simple questions 
about a typical clothes store.

# Running the Project
Follow the instructions or checkout the setup.txt file

  To install nesseacry libraries
  
  1. Set up a virtual python enviorment and install libraries
        
    pip install numpy streamlit torch nltk

  
  To run chat in terminal:
      
    python run chat.py
  
  To run chat with streamlit UI:
  
    streamlit run app.py

# Theory
  The theory behind the ML model. This info is also available in the Theory.txt file


## Data Processing
  Steps Taken to Process the Data
  1. Tokenization
      
  2. Put Everything to Lowercase
      
  3. Stemming
      
  4. Remove Punctuation
      
  5. Bag of Words

Tokenization: Splitting a string into meaningful units
 (ex:words, punctuation, numbers)

Stemming: Generates the root form of the words. Chops of the ends of the words
 Ex: organize, organizes, organizer all become organ

Bag of Words: Collects different words and puts it into an array. Occurence of each words
in the array is used by the model to map input to output

## The Model Used
  Feedforward Neural Net
  
  Input: Bag of Words
  
  Output: Tag
